safe right trafficking and and so on right check out her interview or tia lyles williams founder and ceo of lucas pie bio lucas and pie are the names of her uh grandmothers combined into one name she named her company after her grandmothers um as i understand it and at lucas pie bio which is based in philadelphia or just outside philadelphia and pennsylvania their mission is to make the manufacturing of biotherapies more affordable while growing the bioeconomy and strengthening health care offerings within underserved communities um you can see a sketch of the manufacturing facility her team is is developing and operating in pennsylvania check out what what they have to say um another example barbara jonkosa she's a biotech professor and program director at miracosta college a community college in northern san diego in california and so the college runs a biomanufacturing program where people can learn how to help with biomanufacturing there's a lot of good jobs in a growing economy around manufacturing and if bioeconomy based manufacturing is growing there'll be more jobs there not only are there jobs in biomanufacturing but there's jobs in teaching people about biomanufacturing right so maybe your biotic future as you're learning about bioengineering is to help other people learn about bioengineering one of the things i wanted to do in selecting just a subset of these bio not interviews to highlight them is to give you a like what you might be surprised by a vastly increased uh diversity of of bioengineering futures right it's not just the nerdy stuff with the making of molecules and the designing of the cells it's all the other stuff that the society needs to have a rich and vibrant bioeconomy right the storytelling the law enforcement the education and so on right it's also very interesting to see who can become a leader of a bioengineering operation like sofia's story as a performer and artist suddenly becoming an executive in a mushroom manufacturing company there's no shortage of needs or opportunities in other words and i want to challenge you to think about this forever frankly by just giving you one more postcard this is what are known as the united nations sustainability development goals things that we would like collectively to see made real so that the world would be better like let's get rid of poverty let's get rid of hunger let's make sure everybody has good health and well-being everybody has the option of accessing a quality education that there's gender equality that there's clean water and sanitation for all affordable and so on and so forth right there's 17 different goals here each of these goals is full of opportunities for bioengineers and bionauts and so as a challenge like take a look at these 17 and see if you can just sketch out a bioengineering idea or a bioeconomy opportunity that might if developed help realize one of these goals it's a lot but it means there's a lot of opportunity it also means that most of what bioengineers could do hasn't been imagined yet and so sometimes if not most of the time yeah you could find a job posting and apply for a job but even more powerful is to invent the job once you understand what bioengineering can do that nobody else has understood before you just get to invent your job and suddenly you're writing job postings for other people once you figure that out the last part of this lecture is a warning not to be dramatic but it's really interesting to understand both the power and limitation of economic thinking and so this is a type of friendly warning and i'm so excited to share these next three slides with you because it's just profoundly interesting to stop and think about what the limits of economic thinking are and what lessons we can take from the recent past that might inform each of us and all of us together to shape the bioeconomy we really want right so first beware the label of economy right here's an interesting new york times story from 1999 1999 see what's going on there right and one of the articles is titled computer age gains respect of economists 1999 right for years even as the computer revolutionized the workplace productivity as measured by output stagnated barely advancing one percent a year so it's easy to see why economists didn't care very much about computers you got to be kidding me it's 1999 you know like i was building computer models of virus infection for my phd thesis and shipping that i graduated with my p in 1998 like like a year later finally like computers gained respect of economists right so so like so much interesting stuff was happening in reality well before the economic impact of computing was manifesting right another thing to to note is when you adopt an economic narrative a lot of people then manage for incrementalism like oh let's grow the economy one percent or four percent you know like not very much is going to change it's just going to get a little bit bigger imagine going back in time 50 years to 1973 and it's like we're going to grow the information economy we need more mainframe computers we need four percent more ibm like nothing against ibm but that's not what it's all about it's going to be about uh the arpanet becoming the internet and the personal computer like qualitative disruptive opportunity right so like don't don't let economy become proxy for reality because it's going to favor incremental thinking second warning don't let the economy become a proxy for society i love this example john maynard keynes probably the top economist in the united kingdom in the 20th century so he writes this very interesting essay 1930 right uh 93 years ago the economic possibilities for our grandchildren now what's going on in 1930 from history you remember this is the great depression and so he opens his essay by saying in the middle of the great depression we are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic pessimism well that's funny language for the great depression right um anyway he then goes on to say immediately i believe it's widely mistaken interpretation that the economy is crashing and burning all the way down right we're suffering he writes not from the rheumatics of old age from arthritis but from growing pains of over rapid change um and the painfulness of adjustment from one economic period to the next um he goes on to write right like in the middle of the depression he goes on to write what he imagines life will be like in a hundred years for the grandkids that's you and me like we're the grandkids and and so he says over the long term the economy's going to grow the structural transformations undergirding economic growth are profound i'm so confident in this i'm willing to predict a century of economic growth so the economy is going to be four to eight times as high as it is today compared to 1930 um we're going to solve the economic problem in other words he writes we're going to have so much money that nobody's going to worry about money bold bold bold bold bet john um well he makes a mistake and the mistake he makes is he underestimates the economic growth we actually got today we actually have more money than keynes predicted as i understand it but wait you might say if that's true um is it also the case that nobody has to worry about money no right um there is plenty of money for everybody but not everybody has plenty of money so something was missing in other words from the argument that keynes was putting forward at least in terms of the implementation of what followed we did get the economic growth but we didn't get a society in which everybody has plenty of money hmm don't let economy become a proxy for society in other words make sure we're getting the economy we want as you are bio not and the economy becomes a bioeconomy okay last one and this one's fun and strange and even more esoteric intern yet why did the soviet union fail to build a national computer network i told you it's going to be esoteric but hang on people knew in the 1960s that networking and information technology is going to become important and so there was a decision to make in the 1970s about what to do and different governments made different decisions the united kingdom the british government didn't want to invest in basic research anymore said they'd already figured out networking as was proven in the labs in the 1960s and they wanted to go right to commercialization and economic growth like grow the economy right now with the tools of the 1960s and so they missed out on packet switching networking or tcp ip and and tried to and so they missed out on packet switching networking or tcp ip and and tried to translate too early in the united states we figured out packet switching networking and through public funding built out the early form of the internet known as the arpanet and we did this through uh uh you know public investment and with the backing of the the defense department and then basically gave away those technologies to industry so that the civilian sector could build out the full internet which we understand today which is letting us have this class operating as it is okay sounds pretty good like a little bit of public support in the right next-gen tech unleashed huge qualitative infrastructure improvements and structural transformation of all of our civilization through the internet the soviet union is interesting they understood the power of the network their motivation was economic growth you can hear the leaders of the soviet union at the time brag about how they're going to bury the west in economic growth the shouting and and claiming at the united nations and the way they're going to do this is to have computers control and optimize how the economy is operating and sounds pretty good except the people in the soviet union who had responsibility and therefore power for different sectors of the economy didn't want to give up their power their political power and standing to the computers and so they sabotaged the technology and therefore failed to get a national computer network so the lesson here is if you motivate something only through the lens of economic growth you might ironically fail to get the full power of the technology implemented that's the internet internet example if you motivate something only through economic growth you might not get equity or fairness that's the keynesian example and if you motivate something through economic growth you might not appreciate the qualitatively new disruptive opportunity right so beware even though the economic framing is powerful and transcending fear and unlocking tremendous opportunity for jobs and money and innovation you can't let it be the only thing driving the bus when you build your biotic future so let's reflect really quick what ultimately limits the bioeconomy like why is mckinsey saying it's only four trillion a year why isn't it 40 now should the 21st century bioeconomy be different from the 12th century by economy like the economy used to be 100 biological before we had any technology by definition right so so we want to make sure if we're building a bioeconomy it's progressive and future-facing how are we going to how we're going to figure that out and make sure that happens obviously there's a lot of economic opportunity already but compared to what it's going to be what would you guess is the percentage of jobs in bioengineering that haven't yet been invented that the job postings that nobody's written yet i would guess it's at least half maybe 90 hasn't been imagined yet but what do you think could you invent a new job type in response to one of the un's sustainability development goals speaking of a new job like pick one of the 17 and invent a job you might be inventing the job for yourself or your friend or your cousin and then finally why is it important like beware economic thinking as powerful as is why is it important if not essential to not only think about things through the lens of economy
