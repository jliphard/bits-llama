This week we're going to talk about reading and writing DNA. We're going to go over technologies to sequence and synthesize DNA and we're also going to talk a little bit about how data or information is stored or could be stored in DNA. Now you interact with a lot of data every day. Each text that we send is 50 to 500 bytes of data. The average email is around 10 kilobytes of data. Each photo contains 1.5 to 3.5 megabytes of data. This is the data associated with tweeting or scrolling on TikTok and as a global population each of these texts and emails add up to being a pretty insane amount of data. Globally it's predicted or estimated that we send about 65 billion texts via WhatsApp every day and that's just one messaging service so the true number of texts sent each day is probably much much higher than that. Send about 300 billion emails every day which is the equivalent of 3.4 million emails getting sent every second of every day. There are about 5 billion photos taken every day and more than 700 or 17 million videos posted to TikTok every day. All of this information that we generate all of this data has to be stored somewhere. Some of it is stored locally on your phone but some of it is stored in the cloud and you know we know that this data is stored because we can go back and access it later. I can read text messages that I sent yesterday and look at pictures that I took last year. So we're you know have a data store a looming data storage problem. In 2025 it's predicted that we're going to be generating 33 zettabytes of data each day and a zettabyte is an insane amount of information. Just for reference today we usually talk about petabytes of data and a petabyte of data is a lot of data. It's the equivalent of 20 million filing cabinets completely filled with text right if you were to write really densely on a piece of paper and do that over and over and over again until you filled 20 million four-drawer filing cabinets. That's how much information is stored in a petabyte of data. It's also 13.3 years of HD video. It's just an unfathomably large amount of data and we're already at the point where we're generating multiple petabytes of data each day and a zettabyte of data is a thousand times bigger than a petabyte. There's an error in this slide I'll correct it later. So a zettabyte 33 zettabytes of data is a lot of data and the question is what do we do with all of this data? Where do we store it? Where do we keep our information as a society? Well some data is stored in storage facilities that look like this. This is actually an image of a google storage facility data storage center. You can click this link at the bottom of the slide to see a youtube video where they actually walk you through this center and what you'll see when you watch the video are rows and rows of servers where there's hard drives storing information that you can query and access from google's online interfaces. But when you're not looking at your google doc or you're not looking at your google photo it's sitting there in one of these data centers just waiting for you to access it. It's not clear exactly how much data is stored in each data center but google has several of these all over the world and it's estimated that they currently store about 10 to 15 exabytes of data and so we will need essentially to increase the amount of data that data storage capacity that we have or start to think more carefully about whether we need you know bursts of photos for every situation that we get into. Now I wanted to just think about the kind of digital data information for a minute and think about how we've stored it so that we can contrast it with how data is stored in biological systems. I want you to think for a second about how much data how many petabytes or kilobytes or bytes of data it might take in order to encode you. At the moment no one knows how to do this right we don't know how to download our consciousness or translate our consciousness into zeros and ones so that we could live forever as data in one of those google storage centers but it's an interesting thing to think about right what would it really take to encode a person as bytes of data. Well in some ways we already know right in some ways the instructions to create another one of me is in my DNA. It's in the 23 chromosomes or 3.2 gigabases of DNA. Notice it's gigabases not gigabytes in this case we're talking about a's t's c's and g's we're talking about the building blocks of DNA but inside each one of my cells are 3.2 billion of these bases of DNA and together they make the instructions for me and DNA is that's kind of incredible that's actually many orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of data that I generate on a yearly basis but DNA is an incredible storage medium right in this DNA there are about 20 to 25,000 protein coding genes so in this quarter we've talked about how you know DNA leads to RNA leads to protein that's kind of the canonical central dogma of biology and yet only our genome only encodes for 20 to 25,000 of these protein coding genes actually only about two percent of the genome codes for proteins the rest of it is other information some of that information is telling your body or your cells when to express certain genes so some of that DNA is in promoter and terminator regions that choose basically where to turn on the expression of genes here's an example where this is supposed to be a promoter driving expression of a gene that is important for muscle cell movement and this promoter would basically only be active in muscle cells so that you get efficient muscle movement you actually don't need the protein that this gene encodes in other cells within the body and so that's where some of that DNA information is taken up it's in these protein or these promoter regions these what we call regulatory regions of DNA now it might seem like that's kind of flat right there's just it just maybe doesn't take a lot to be able to encode for a person it's not all that complicated to make one if it's just 3.2 billion bases of DNA and some bases are serving to tell um your uh polymerase and ribosomes when to translate or create a protein from a gene it does not all that complicated but that's not it's not that straightforward there's actually multiple layers of regulation and multiple ways in which a single protein coding gene can produce different proteins based on what's happening in their environment one example of this is called alternative splicing so if we think about the example that i just showed you where there's this important gene for muscle movement and we you know think of it as being one gene makes one protein then there's not a lot of flexibility there we basically can decide to make that protein or not we can decide to make a little bit of it or a lot of it we're always making that protein in a world where this DNA sequence is always read um directly but sometimes um RNAs are spliced so there are in human systems and actually eukaryotes in general uh introns in between the portions of the genome that encode for the protein so an RNA actually gets spliced together into a um kind of new form from the form that a polymerase makes into what's called a splice form that is then translated into a protein and there's actually different ways that you can splice genes together to get different protein products so here these bars are supposed to show you different proteins and the RNA or the gene is shown on the left and so if the RNA if every intron in a gene is spliced out you get what's called constitutive splicing and that gives you one protein but if you get exon skipping where you splice out this entire pink region and the protein that you make doesn't have the amino acids that correlate to that pink region you can get intron uh retention so that's here where you get pieces of the intron being encoded in your protein there's also a little bit of that here and so what i'm trying to show you is that a single gene can actually encode for several different proteins so there's some overlap right a base doesn't always have the same function in every situation because these alternative splicings can occur under different environmental conditions maybe you're running and you need to make more of that protein in order to facilitate faster movement of your muscle fibers and the protein form that is usually made is not as efficient as this other protein form and so you might have alternative splicing where you start making more of this in a situation where you're running quickly just as a hypothetical example that's one way in which information is sort of layered in dna and it's not in electronic systems another way so okay here are different forms of the human protein tropomyosin 2 that have been identified to date and so tropomyosin 2 is an example of a protein that does kind of facilitate the movement of fibers during muscle contraction and you can see that there this if this is the full length gene with all of the introns shown as flat lines and the exon shown as boxes you can see that there are several different splice forms that get made within the human body so this one segment of dna although it looks like it's only encoding for one protein is actually encoding in this case for at least five or six different types of protein so i think that's interesting another way in which dna is an information rich carrier is because the shape of the dna actually can affect gene expression so like splicing shape is another layer in which information is encoded within dna so what do i mean by the shape of the dna well it turns out when polymerases are actively transcribing dna they lead to positive or negative super coils and positive super coils on either side of it so if you've ever played with your shoelaces and you twist them you can actually get them to coil up and that's the same type of thing that's happening with your dna as a polymerase is moving along so you can try this if you take your a cord for something and you twist it a little bit so that you have a little bit of a twist and then you pull you can get even tighter coiling right and if you keep doing that you can get these super coils to form and actually proteins like polymerases will preferentially bind to negative super coils and initiate more transcription in parts of dna that are negatively super coiled and so it's responding not just to the sequence of dna but actually to the three-dimensional shape that it's coiling into as well and so certain sequences will coil more readily than others and that's one way or another way in which more information is encoded in these in these proteins should say that there are also proteins that actively regulate the super coiling state of dna so topoisomerase 2 is an example of a protein that comes through and relaxes these super coils so it's you know heavily regulated within your cell what the shape of the dna looks like in addition to the sequence that shape is important for getting good gene expression or you know accurately running your genetic program okay so small changes in dna sequence can dramatically change the phenotype of a biological system this is claude this is an albino alligator who lives at the california academy of science i've seen him he's really cute he has a mutation in a gene that's essential for making melanin which is a pigment that would usually make claude a kind of darker brown color but because he's missing that pigment he is this nice or kind of intensely white uh alligator he's albino so what is the mutation that causes albinism well uh we have i couldn't find the genome sequence for claude but what i could find was um the sequence or analysis of albino zebrafish so this is a wild type zebrafish which has these beautiful stripes and an albino zebrafish does not have the capacity to make those striped pigments so he's not striped and this albino zebrafish has a premature stop codon in a protein that's important for melanin production that protein is called slc45a2 and my mouth little doesn't mean a lot but this stop codon means that the gene is not expressed in these zebrafish and a single gene deletion the missing one protein is causing this pretty striking phenotype here's just the genome sequence of the wild type zebrafish this is the codon that would usually encode for a glycine and when it's mutated when this first base is mutated to a t like it is in these albino fish you get a stop codon instead and so as the ribosome is reading through it reads this stop and it says oh i'm done and it stops making protein so you get a truncated form of this slc45a2 and you don't get the full protein that you need in order to make melanin in these fish so that was um a nice demonstration of how important dna sequence can be and how important small changes can be in the phenotype of an organism now it's not just in the protein coding regions that changes in dna sequence can dramatically alter an organism's phenotype here's an example from tomato where the authors made or the scientists made changes in the promoter region upstream of a gene called clavata3 these mutations change how strongly clavata3 is expressed so in the wild type it's expressed pretty strongly and then as you make more and more mutations you reduce the amount of clavata3 and you get um uh different phenotypes here and so you can see the the fruit locule number or kind of the um and also the size of the fruit changes as you change the expression of this gene so this week we're going to go through dna reading and writing right how do we know that those changes in dna are underpinning those phenotypes how are we able to observe what the sequence of dna is right we can't take it out of ourselves and just like look at it there are methods for figuring out what the sequence of dna is and so we're going to go over kind of the cutting edge of dna sequencing and then we're also going to talk about how you can write completely new sequences of dna our reflective questions for the week or for this section are how much data like let's start thinking about how much data is encoded in all of the organisms you interact with um we have a lot of statistics about how much data you interact with through your phone or through the internet but how much are you interacting with biotically and then why do changes in dna alter living organisms we talked about how changes may lead to proteins no longer being expressed or to changes in how much protein is being expressed but are there other things you can think of and then what are the potential benefits of sequencing an organism's genome we'll get into this a little bit in the next lecture but i'd like you to think about it for yourself what could you learn by sequencing an organism's genome and then finally why are people interested in synthesizing new sequences of dna what are the potential advantages of being able to do that all right i'm excited to talk to you about dna technology this week and i'll meet you at the next lecture
