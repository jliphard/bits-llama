My name is Ahmed Best. I don't necessarily have a title, I mean a professor maybe is probably the closest academic title that I have. I'm an artist, and I come at bioengineering from the storytelling world. And it really is, and I always tell this to Drew like I didn't go to school for science but I love it so much that I call myself like a science hobbyist, and most people look at hobbies like, you know, building model ships or, you know, saying that I learned how to play the guitar. I'm really more about like diving into some, some serious scientific ideas and and professionally. I try to be as communicative as possible when it comes to science when it comes to talking to people about it. I tend to live in these two worlds of, you know, as an artist, as a performing artist and somebody who does like film and TV for a living and theater for a living and games you know I also write and direct video games. I have an ability to communicate scientific ideas, emotionally, and be able to get across those ideas by scientists. So people can understand what they're passionate about, you know, a lot of times when we talk about science we talk about scientists we're talking about the opinions of the data, right, what through the science and not the passion of why scientists actually started doing this in the first place, right. So scientists are really kind of reduced to these people who spit data and there's just so much more to it than that. When it comes to bioengineering, especially when it comes to like the reason why I know you and the reason why Drew Endy is such a dear friend is because the way Drew comes out bioengineering is so incredibly creative and accessible and it doesn't frighten you, it excites you and every time people talk about biology or bioengineering or synthetic biology everyone gets afraid, right. And so talking to Drew you're more amazed, you're more fascinated, and you're more afraid and I just want to amplify that message, you know, especially when it comes to talking about things as important as bioengineering. You know I've always loved, I've always loved science since I was a kid, you know, I grew up in New York City, I was a very nerdy kid, I read a lot of comic books, but I really, all my science classes from elementary school were my favorite classes. And I remember, you know, I'm a slight bit older than you, but I remember when my science teacher in fifth grade wheeled a computer into the room and I was hooked, I was hooked. Ever since I first saw it, right, and it was a Commodore PET, I don't know if anybody even knows what the hell, this was like before the Commodore 64, which was like the computer of the 80s, right, but this was like a Commodore PET and the first language that I learned was called BASIC, I don't even know if BASIC even exists anymore, but I remember like doing this really super simple string scripts in BASIC and it was just my name, you know, I would just put my name in there and then the entire screen like filled with my name and it scrolled infinitely and I was just amazed, I loved it, I loved every minute of it. And so I just wanted to be a part of whatever was going on and, you know, computer science was the science class, right, and then when I got to high school it was like physics and I was just blown away by physics and I wanted to go into physics, if it wasn't for like music and acting really called me because I was going the science way, right, and when I was in high school they made you choose and I didn't want to choose, you know, I really wanted to do it all because I saw the relationship between science and the arts and, you know, historically back in the ancient times it was the same thing, you know, artists and scientists were one in the same and it wasn't until, you know, a lot later in the like, you know, late 18th, 19th century that it got separated into these two different schools of thought, right, but I always kept a little toe in the science world, you know, I always had friends who were scientists, I always talked to them, I'm intensely like curious, I always want to know something, I'm always fascinated by things and I love learning, like I'm a huge learner, so I get science newsletters every five minutes and I always have. It wasn't until, it wasn't really until COVID-19 dropped when I was just like somebody has to say something about this and I had been doing a lot of work with the National Academy of Science. I was doing, I do, I host events for the National Academy of Sciences Science and Entertainment Exchange, right, which is, it's a small department in the National Academy of Science that provides scientists with storytellers, right, so all the hard science that's in every movie that comes from the Science and Entertainment Exchange, right, so they connect scientists and movie producers, movie writers, artists, and so on and so forth, and so I started hosting events with the Science and Entertainment Exchange and I realized that a lot of scientists were not really good at talking about what they're doing and talking about it in a way that makes you feel why it's important, right, they can, they can talk about the data and they can tell you statistically why it's important, but you know what they don't tell you is how they feel about what they're doing and how they feel about your opinion of what they're doing, and so when COVID-19 came around and everybody had this enormous like mistrust of scientists, specifically like biologists, biologists, epidemiologists, I recognized that there was a little bit of a gap in the translation between the data, the scientists, and the rest of the people, and so that's when I kind of really jumped in and I was like, I speak these languages, I can speak both languages, I can understand enough to translate the science into something that's accessible and entertaining and fun, and that's when I kind of really jumped in. Yeah, I mean personally I believe that as an artist and as an artist who is inherently an optimist, it really is important for me to see that optimistic future, right, it's really important for me to help create that optimistic future, right, and I was a ridiculous Star Trek fan, right, so for me it's always been like I want to live in that world, like how do we make that happen, you know, how do we make replicators happen, how do we make tricorders happen, how do we make starships happen, right, and I think everyone who's seen a Star Trek and picked up something and invented something that reminds them of Star Trek, I think they have that same feeling, which is like we can do this, you know, one of the things that I loved about Star Trek is there's no money, nobody ever talks about like taxes, nobody ever talks about finance, and you know they go well we don't do money anymore, like we don't need it, you know, the wealth is in human experience, exploration, and learning, like that's currency, you know, and it sounds good, and when you think about it like oh in the future, in 100 years, in 200 years, we're going to have that, right, but who's thinking about how to get there, you know, who's thinking about what are the steps it takes to get to that place, scientists are, you know what I'm saying, like that's who's thinking about it, it's like artists and scientists, we're the ones thinking about that kind of stuff, how do we get to Star Trek, which is why when it comes together you have wonderful things like smartphones and VR headsets and tablets and, you know, the internet, you know, because we are trying to get to, you know, deep space, you know, we're trying to be able to explore that. Now when it comes to bioengineering, like the thing that Star Trek really doesn't talk about too much is sickbay, right, like I have, I wrote this whole thing that one of these days somebody's gonna buy from me and it'll be on some kind of a network, but I wrote a whole Star Trek show called Starfleet Medical, right, and it really is about the bio side of the federation, because nobody talks about how there's no cancer anymore, you know what I'm saying, like they look at these diseases in Star Trek and they just go let's do that, synthesize that, make, and then all of a sudden there's a hypospray and it's like done, like no sickness anymore, you know, the whole bio side is like, oh we figured that out, like we figured how that, you know, synthesize these elements, put them together, hypospray, they don't even put it in arms, you know, it's like over clothes, you could be wearing like a down jacket and it's like, no, I'm cured, you're cured, you know what I'm saying, how do we get there, right, and if somewhere along the line, creating the federation, we all started trusting biology, you know, somewhere along the line, we all started trusting the fact that people have our best interests at heart when we're creating these things, right, but I think a lot of it is because there's a lot of mythology, especially in the west, around who we are, you know, how we got here, what are we made of, you know, and the mythology takes over from the research, the mythology takes over from the facts and I don't think people really understand that there are disciplines in science and science is not a religion, you know what I'm saying, like science is a method, it's a way of doing things, right, the same science that built the smartphone is the science that did the corona vaccine, right, and it's not because it's bioengineering and, you know, computer software and hardware engineering, it's like the steps that it takes to find the answers are the same and I don't think the community writ large really understands that it's the steps, right, and not necessarily the disciplines, so we have to make sure that everybody knows that we are all taking the same steps towards best interests. I think we also have to let everyone know that biology is not scary and that is only going to come if we give agency of our biology back to us. There's so much about our biology that we don't know for a reason, right, and our biology has become industry and, you know, Drew and I talk about this all the time, we always talk about how everyone should have the right to their own DNA, you know, we talk about how everyone should be able to print DNA in their living room or in their kitchen, right, we should all have, we should all have access and right to DNA, but there are some things about DNA that we don't talk about or we don't understand because it's not given to us, we have to go to Stanford or take a course like this and get that information where in actuality it should be every day, like we should all know what our DNA does, we should all be able to have access to our personal DNA information, we should all be able to know that, you know, where it comes from, how we create it, what makes us us, how to read it, we should be able to read the, you know, A's, C's, G's and T's just like we can read websites, you know, it should be bad accessible, but because of industry it's kept from us so that I can understand how there could be distrust and mistrust because when we start thinking about DNA, especially our DNA, we're all of a sudden we start talking about the pharmaceutical industry, we start talking about the medical industry, we're not talking about DNA anymore, now we're talking about systems, right, the systems have nothing to do with the biology, you're trusting or distrusting the systems, right, the biology ain't do nothing to you, you know what I'm saying, the information doesn't do anything to you, but the systems do, so regardless of, you know, how you feel and where you stand on it, what we don't trust and what needs to be articulated, it has nothing to do with the DNA, it has everything to do with the systems in place that keep our DNA information from us. For me, it first starts with this idea that science is awesome, like I love the awesomeness of it and I'm blown away by it, right, I'm blown away by it, I'm blown away that this series of steps can get you to innovations that can change everything, all of us, you know, it's really amazing, it's really awesome, it's really awesome that we figured this out as human beings, you know, one chromosome away from the lesser primates, right, the lesser quote-unquote primates, but we got it, like we figured it out and it's fantastic and there's everything that, the reason why I can make the films that I make or the the things that I make, the creativity that I make and you can feel it, it doesn't exist without somebody coming up with a medium that can distribute it, right, even we're talking about theater, like somebody had to come up with lights, you know what I'm saying, and you know, a room that you can have sounded and, you know, a way to the, you know, the mathematical angles of a rake of a stage, so everybody can see what's going on, like it's all integrated, it's all a part of it, which is why I'm not big on like separating the arts and the sciences, I think, you know, as a collaborative system, we can, it needs to work together, but the first thing I have is like this idea of like exponential creativity and imagination, I want to see the future now, you know what I'm saying, and the best way for me to do that is to speculate on what the future could be, right, and so you'll come up with this ridiculous idea and you'll talk to a scientist and they'll be just like, oh, okay, we can do, you know what I'm saying, like we might not be able to do it today, but I definitely see a future in which that can be done, right, Drew has this really good talk on purple mucus, you ever hear him talk about this, pretty dope, it's pretty dope, right, you know what I'm saying, like he said, imagine if you have an ailment, right, yeah, and the color of your mucus can tell you what kind of ailment you have, right, so say you have COVID and your mucus is purple, you automatically know that you have COVID, you can go get treated, right, yeah, unreal, that is unbelievable, right, but from a bioengineer standpoint, bioengineers are just like, oh yeah, we can make that, let's make that, right, and so me as an artist, as a writer, as a director, as a creator, right, I can go, hey, let me write something that has purple mucus in it, right, and take away the fear, take away the stigma, because you see a story with that in it, you'll be like, oh, wow, this is something, right, can, is that really possible, and then you find somebody who can go, hey, yeah, we can do that, okay, let's do it, and then all of a sudden, like, we're all on the same page, moving towards the future together, right, but really the only way out of all of the scare is to make stories, it's the only way, we can't data our way out of it, we can't infotech our way out of it, we have to create narratives around it, so people can emotionally and tangibly embrace the ideas, and not be afraid of the ideas, the lack of information and the lack of creativity creates the fear, right, making things a lot less accessible creates the fear, the not knowing makes you fearful, as soon as you know, you're just like, oh, I know what that is, I don't have to, you know, I can just go forward, you know, I once saw, I was looking at a website, and I was talking to a bioengineer, and he was talking about, he put up on the screen, the DNA makeup of anthrax, and he was like, oh, you can make anthrax.
