<!--
Students completing BIOE.80 should have a working understanding for how to approach the systematic engineering of living systems to benefit all people and the planet.
Our main goals are:
<br><br>
(1) to help students learn ways of thinking about engineering living matter and
<br><br>
(2) to empower students to explore the broader ramifications of engineering life.
<br><br>
Specific concepts and skills covered include but are not limited to: capacities of natural life on Earth; scope of the existing human-directed bioeconomy; deconstructing complicated problems; reaction & diffusion systems; microbial human anatomy; conceptualizing the engineering of biology; how atoms can be organized to make molecules; how to print DNA from scratch; programming genetic sensors, logic, & actuators; biology beyond molecules (photons, electrons, etc.); what constraints limit what life can do; what will be the major health challenges in 2030; how does what we want shape bioengineering; who should choose and realize various competing bioengineering futures?
