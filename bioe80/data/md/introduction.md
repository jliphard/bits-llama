# Introduction to Bioengineering (Engineering Living Matter)

## Course Goals

Students successfully completing BIOE/ENGR.80 will have a working understanding for how to approach the systematic engineering of living systems to benefit all people and the planet. Our four main goals for the quarter are (1) to help you learn ways of thinking about engineering living matter, (2) to empower you to explore and do bioengineering starting from DNA, and (3) for you to become more capable of learning and explaining bioengineering to yourself and others, including discussing the broader ramifications of engineering the living world. (4) Specific to Spring 2020, in the time of COVID-19 and at the dawn of a decade, we also aim to enable you to devise and express your wishes for bioengineering as might be made true by or before 2030, and to develop practical plans for making you wishes real.

## How does this class work?

There are usually three class sessions each week (MWF).  The in-class sessions are a mix of active learning and short lectures.  In a typical week, you will read the pre- or post-class material, attend the in-class sessions or activity, and do one problem set.  The course grade is based on your problem sets and your final group project, with quizes serving to make it easier to pass your PSETS and Final Project.  Bioengineering is a fast moving area, with big advances (and controversies) every few weeks, so keep your eyes open and let us all know when you learn about things that relate to bioengineering, genomics, or synthetic biology!
