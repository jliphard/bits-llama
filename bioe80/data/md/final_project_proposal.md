# BIOE 80 Final Project (15% of Grade)
## Design Problem

The goal of this project is to help students integrate the different concepts in class and practice designing Bioengineering solutions to current problems. 

In groups of 3-4, students will identify a current need and propose a bioengineering solution. They will create a BIOE 80 Wiki post (about 3 to 4 pages of text) that will be accessible to future students which will explain how bioengineering can be used to solve the worldâ€™s problems.

Assessment will be based on the following:

**Identification and Description of Need:** 15 points
* Instructors can offer suggested sources, ie: kiva.org
* Describe the problem and who is affected by it

**Description of Currently Available Solutions:** 15 points
* Both bioengineering and non-bioengineering

**Proposal of bioengineering-based solution:** 25 points
* Describe advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of this solution
* Back-of-the-envelope calculations can be required, ie: estimate of cost, estimate of how many people would be impacted
* What other trends and technologies are required for the bioengineering solution 

**Description of Ethical Ramifications:** 15 points
* Ethical implications of taking action
* Ethical implications of inaction

**References:** 10 points
* Students should include citations, as appropriate

**Structure:** 10 points
* Clarity, Spelling, Grammar, etc.
* Appropriate use of visuals

**Group Participation:** 10 points
* Since this is a group project, each student will evaluate how much other students contributed to the project. Grades may thus differ between students within a group.

Total: 100 points

**Scaffolding, Logistics, and milestones:**
* Group formation and initial brainstorming by the end of week 4
* A TA can be assigned to each group as a mentor
* Problem identification by the end of week 6
* Required TA check-in during week 8 
* Project due Wednesday, June 5th (Final class session) week 10 
* Submit link to mateiral to the teaching team

* To simplify other aspacts problem sets can be shortend
