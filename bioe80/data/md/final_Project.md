# Introduce the World to Bioengineering 
## BIOE 80 Final Project (15% of Grade)

The goal of the group project is for you, as BIOE.80 and ENGR.80 students, to communicate and introduce Bioengineering to a non-expert audience of your choice. (For example, you may choose your audience to be next year's incoming BIOE.80 class.) The goal of this project is to enable you to think about and reflect on Bioengineering as a 21st-century discipline grounded in engineering living matter.

In this project, you will answer the questions, "What is bioengineering?" and "Why is it important to know about it?"  
This may include a description of the application of Bioengineering to contemporary challenges, an explanation of new ways of thinking that emerge as various bioengineering technologies develop (e.g.: DNA sequencing, synthesis, and CRISPR gene editing tools), or the application and description of sciences (e.g.: evolution and diffusion) at the intersection of engineering living matter. 

In groups of 3-4, you will create a world-readable webpage **"BIOE 80 Wiki Post"** addressing your topic of choice.  The final report should be between 3-4 pages (excluding references).  

Please form teams and share your group member list with the course staff by week 4. 

The Final project is due on our last class session of week 10 (i.e., Wednesday, June 5th). 

**Support:** Your team will be assigned a primary mentor (one of the teaching assistants),  that will check in with you throughout the quarter. You will be asked to submit parts of your progress throughout the quarter as part of the problem sets. 

The Hume Center for Writing is another on-campus resource [link](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/tutoring-support/hume-center)

Your grade will be based on the following:

**Identification and Description of the topic:** 20 points
* Define Bioengineering and identify a particular context (i.e., need or topic that Bioengineering addresses)
* Describe the relevance of that topic to your chosen audience
* Provide relevant historical and scientific background for your topic

**Description of the Science & Technology:** 20 points
* Describe the role of Bioengineering in impacting your topic 
* Identify advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of engineering living matter
* Identify resources for getting more information

**Description of Social Ramifications:** 15 points
* Identify the stakeholders associated with your topic
* Describe the social, political, and/or economic implications of new technologies in this area

**Quantitative Due Diligence:** 10 points
* Include back-of-the-envelope calculations, e.g.: estimate of requirements, cost, or impact (how many people would be impacted)

**References:** 5 points
* Students should include citations, as appropriate (looking for a consistent style)

**Structure:** 10 points
* Clarity, Spelling, Grammar, etc.
* Definition of key terms and limited use of jargon
* Appropriate use of visuals

**Group Participation:** 20 points
* Since this is a group project, each student will evaluate how much other students contributed to the project. 
Grades may differ between students within a group.

Total: 100 points  

**Scaffolding, Logistics, and Milestones:**
* Each group will be assigned a TA as a mentor
* Group formation and initial brainstorming by the end of **week 4**
* Topic identification by the end of **week 5**
* Required TA check-in during **weeks 7, 8, and 9**
* Project due Wednesday, June 5th (Final class session) **week 10**
