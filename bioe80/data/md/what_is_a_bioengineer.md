# BIOE 80 Who is a bioengineer? Activity

**Goal:** As part of the introduction to the course, assess student viewpoints on what makes up a bioengineer. As a relatively young discipline, bioengineering can be hard to define. This activity will help students think about their own conceptions of bioengineers and how this course might affect those ideas. This activity can be repeated at the end of the course to see how, if at all, ideas of bioengineers may have changed.

**Prompt:** Imagine a bioengineer. In the following diagram, sketch your idea of a bioengineer. In the 3 circles, write down 3 words to describe bioengineers.

**Activity:** Give students 5-10 minutes to fill out the sheet. Then, have them discuss in pairs how their sketches/words were similar, and how they differed. Bring this back into the large group and ask for a few volunteers to share back on their ideas of who is a bioengineer. Offer the instructorsâ€™ vision of a bioengineer--or questions of what makes up a bioengineer--and how this class will examine those viewpoints. 

**Follow-up:** Collect the handouts from students. Quickly glance through them, and share impressions from the sketches in the next class. Ie: you notice everyone drew someone holding a pipette, or there were very few similarities among the drawings. 

**Alternate activity:** Using PollEverywhere (Stanford has a license to this clicker-type survey system), submit 3 words that describe Bioengineers (or hyphenated phrases). Allow students to respond via phone or laptop, then display the results as a word cloud. Ask students to take a minute to share with their neighbor anything that strikes them about bioengineers. Again, you can bring this back into a large group, and comment on how this class will require (or not) those adjectives.
