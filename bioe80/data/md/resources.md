This list organizes two types of extra resources for your consideration. Everything here is optional but valuable. 

First, we have a set of links to software tools supporting design and analysis of biomolecular and genetic systems. Learning to use these tools is a great way to gain understanding and also demonstrate to others (e.g., future co-founders or employers) that you can do useful things with state of the art software. Second, we have a set of links to background reading in case you wish to learn more about the details of biology. We will periodically update this post with new resources, so check back!


## Biomolecular Analysis and Design Tools
- [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/): Useful online tool offered by for-profit company started by iGEM students from MIT. Supports tracking of DNA parts and analysis and layout of DNA sequences, primarily at the scale of plasmids (vectors)

- [PDB Structure Viewer](https://www.rcsb.org/#Category-visualize): In-browser structure viewers from the Protein Data Bank (every molecule at PDB can be viewed in browser).

- [Meta Link](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/thirdparty/molecular_graphics): Many molecular graphics analysis and design tools curated by the Protein Data Bank.

- [PyMol](https://pymol.org/2/): Professional grade molecular structure viewer.

- [FoldIt](https://fold.it/portal/): Protein folding computer game (based on software engine used to design proteins, like KumaMax example).

- [eterna](https://eternagame.org/home/): Tool, game, and community for analysis and design of RNA molecules

## Extra Learning Resources

- Molecular Biology of the Cell: 4th edition by Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, and Peter Walter. This is the go-to molecular biology textbook used by advanced undergrad classes and graduate students. Older editions are ok because foundational biology topics are generally unchanged. Topics include: molecular biology, DNA, RNA, protein, translation, transcription, and others. Available from amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Biology-Cell-Bruce-Alberts-ebook-dp-B00PWDH4RW/dp/B00PWDH4RW/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=).

- The Molecules of Life: Physical and Chemical Properties by John Kuriyan, Boyana Konforti, and David Wemmer. This textbook is for advanced undergraduates interested in exploring more in-depth material on the biochemical structure of macromolecules, energetics of protein folding, and other biophysical concepts. Chapters 1-4 are especially relevant to topics discussed in class. [Link to Stanford Libraries catalog](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/9583986). Unfortunately I can't find a full online version, but the Google books preview is [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=jwcPBAAAQBAJ).

- [Allen Institute's Cell Explorer](https://www.allencell.org/): Resource for looking at mammallian cells as they are being observed via microscopy, studied, and figured out.

- Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry </em>by David L. Nelson; Michael M. Cox. [Ebook](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/ca/product/Lehninger-Principles-of-Biochemistry/p/1464126119)

- The Machinery of Life by David S. Goodsell. An electronic copy of the book is available for free from Stanford Library and you should be able to access from [here](https://stanford.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-84925-6).

- Cell Biology by the Numbers by Ron Milo: order of magnitude estimations in biology free download and website from [here](http://book.bionumbers.org/).
