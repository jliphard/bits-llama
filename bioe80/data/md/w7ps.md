***Written project description (24 pts, 3 points per, Due: Monday June 1st)***  

Answer the following eight questions (adapted from DARPA's Heilmeier Catechism):

- What are you trying to do? Succinctly articulate your wish using absolutely no jargon.

- What's happening today, what is the problem, or what are the limits of current practice?

- What is new in your approach and why do you think you will be successful?

- Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will your success make?

- What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

- What is the greatest obstacle to your success?

- What could go horribly wrong? What are the risks?

- How much will it cost?  How long will it take?
